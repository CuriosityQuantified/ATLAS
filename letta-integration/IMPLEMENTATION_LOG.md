# Letta Integration Implementation Log

## Goal
Integrate Letta (formerly MemGPT) into ATLAS to provide an Agent Development Environment with the following capabilities:
1. Create, edit, and converse with Letta agents via frontend interface
2. Create, edit, and converse with Letta agents through local IDE
3. View locally IDE-created agents in the frontend interface

## Key Resources
- Letta Repository: https://github.com/letta-ai/letta
- ATLAS Project: /Users/nicholaspate/Documents/ATLAS

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Research and Setup
- [ ] Review Letta documentation and architecture
- [ ] Understand Letta's Agent Development Environment (ADE)
- [ ] Identify integration points with ATLAS

### Phase 2: Backend Integration
- [ ] Install Letta Python package
- [ ] Create Letta service module in backend
- [ ] Implement API endpoints for agent management
- [ ] Set up Letta configuration and storage

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
- [ ] Design Agent Development Environment UI
- [ ] Create agent list/grid component
- [ ] Implement agent creation form
- [ ] Build agent editing interface
- [ ] Develop conversation/chat interface

### Phase 4: Local IDE Integration
- [ ] Configure Letta for local development
- [ ] Create scripts for agent management via CLI
- [ ] Implement file watchers for agent sync
- [ ] Test IDE-based workflows

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test agent creation from frontend
- [ ] Test agent editing functionality
- [ ] Test conversation interface
- [ ] Verify IDE-created agents appear in frontend
- [ ] End-to-end workflow testing

## Progress Log

### 2025-01-24 - Initial Setup
- Created letta-integration folder structure
- Established implementation plan and todo list

### 2025-01-24 - Research Phase
- Reviewed Letta GitHub repository
- Key findings:
  - Letta provides ADE (Agent Development Environment) as a GUI
  - Docker deployment recommended for production (PostgreSQL backend)
  - pip install available for development (SQLite backend)
  - REST API and Python/TypeScript SDKs available
  - Model-agnostic (supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.)
  - Agents have persistent memory and can update their own state
  
- Integration approach:
  - Use pip install for development phase
  - Integrate Letta Python SDK with ATLAS backend
  - Create custom frontend ADE interface within ATLAS
  - Use Letta REST API for frontend-backend communication

### 2025-01-24 - Backend Integration Setup
- Installed Letta package via uv pip
- Created backend integration structure:
  - `/backend/src/letta/` - Main Letta module
  - `models.py` - Pydantic models for agents, messages, conversations
  - `service.py` - LettaService class for agent management
  - `__init__.py` - Module exports
- Created API endpoints:
  - `/backend/src/api/letta_endpoints.py` - RESTful endpoints
  - Integrated with AG-UI for real-time updates
  - Endpoints for CRUD operations on agents
  - Message sending and conversation history
- Updated main.py to include Letta router

### 2025-01-24 - Frontend Development
- Created Agent Development Environment UI:
  - `/frontend/src/app/letta-ade/page.tsx` - Main ADE page
  - Agent list with create/delete functionality
  - Agent selection and details view
  - Create agent modal with configuration options
- Created Chat Interface component:
  - `/frontend/src/components/letta/ChatInterface.tsx`
  - Real-time message sending and receiving
  - Conversation history display
  - Loading states and auto-scroll
- Added navigation:
  - Updated Dashboard component to include Letta ADE tab
  - Added "Letta ADE" to sidebar navigation
  - Integrated as iframe within main dashboard

### 2025-01-24 - CLI Tool and Documentation
- Created CLI tool for local IDE integration:
  - `letta_cli.py` - Full-featured command line interface
  - Commands: list, create, delete, chat, history, export
  - Interactive chat mode with agents
  - Export/import functionality for agent configurations
- Created comprehensive documentation:
  - README.md with usage instructions
  - API endpoint documentation
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Example workflows

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed Features
1. **Backend Integration**
   - Letta service with full CRUD operations
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - AG-UI real-time event broadcasting
   - Conversation history management

2. **Frontend ADE**
   - Agent list with create/delete
   - Real-time chat interface
   - Integration with main ATLAS dashboard

3. **CLI Tool**
   - Complete agent management from terminal
   - Interactive chat sessions
   - Export/import capabilities

### ðŸ”„ Pending Features
- Agent editing functionality (UI for updating agent configurations)
- End-to-end testing of all three workflows

### ðŸ“‹ Key Test Scenarios
1. **Frontend Agent Creation**
   - Create agent via web UI
   - Verify agent appears in list
   - Test chat functionality

2. **CLI Agent Management**
   - Create agent via CLI
   - Verify agent appears in web UI
   - Chat with agent from terminal

3. **Cross-Platform Sync**
   - Create agent in CLI, chat in web
   - Create agent in web, chat in CLI
   - Verify conversation history syncs

## Next Steps
1. Start backend and frontend servers
2. Test agent creation workflows
3. Verify CLI-to-frontend synchronization
4. Implement agent editing if needed
