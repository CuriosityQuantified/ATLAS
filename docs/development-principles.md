### Overarching points to follow
# Produce DRY, modular code
# Produce easily mainable code
# Produce easily readable code
# Do not attempt to overoptimize the codebase
# You tend to produce too many lines of code based on what is needed, for example writing 100s of lines for something that could be done in 50 lines. Aim for less code as able.
