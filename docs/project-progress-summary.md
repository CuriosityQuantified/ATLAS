## Current Session Progress: Tool Call Visualization ✅

### Problem Addressed
The chat interface was showing agent responses but not visualizing the tool calls that the supervisor makes, making it difficult to understand the system's decision-making process.

### Solution Implemented

#### Backend Enhancements:
1. **Added Tool Call Events** to AG-UI protocol:
   - `TOOL_CALL_INITIATED` - When a tool is about to be called
   - `TOOL_CALL_EXECUTING` - When execution begins
   - `TOOL_CALL_COMPLETED` - When tool returns successfully
   - `TOOL_CALL_FAILED` - When tool execution fails

2. **Modified Supervisor Agent** to broadcast tool events:
   - Tracks execution time for each tool call
   - Broadcasts structured data including arguments and results
   - Maintains tool call IDs for tracking

#### Frontend Enhancements:
1. **Created ToolCallBox Component**:
   - Expandable/collapsible visualization
   - Status indicators (pending/executing/complete/failed)
   - Displays tool arguments and results
   - Shows execution time

2. **Updated TasksView**:
   - Added tool call state management
   - Implemented WebSocket handlers for tool events
   - Mixed content stream showing messages and tool calls

### Result
The chat interface now provides clear visualization of the supervisor's workflow, showing:
- User messages → Tool executions → Agent responses
- Real-time status updates as tools execute
- Detailed information about what each tool is doing
- Clear indication of success/failure
