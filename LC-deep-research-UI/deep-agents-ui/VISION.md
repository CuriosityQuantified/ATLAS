# Deep Agents UI - Enhanced Vision

## Overview
Transform the deep-agents-ui into a comprehensive, multi-modal development environment that seamlessly integrates agent capabilities with native file management, document editing, and workflow automation.

## Core Vision Components

### 1. Multi-Tab Workspace System
- **Unlimited Concurrent Sessions**: Each tab represents an independent workspace/chat session
- **Tab Management**: 
  - Left sidebar with collapsible tab list (similar to current workspace window)
  - Visual indicators for active/inactive tabs
  - Ability to rename, reorder, and close tabs
  - Session persistence across browser refreshes
- **Isolated Contexts**: Each tab maintains its own:
  - Chat history
  - File system workspace
  - Agent state
  - Variable context

### 2. Advanced Code Rendering
- **Live Preview**: Similar to Lovable or v0, with instant rendering of:
  - HTML/CSS/JavaScript
  - React components
  - Full applications
- **Split View**: Code editor alongside live preview
- **Hot Reload**: Automatic updates as code changes

### 3. Native File System Management
- **Visual File Explorer**:
  - Tree view of workspace files and folders
  - Drag-and-drop file operations
  - Context menus for file operations
  - Search and filter capabilities
- **Inline File Editing**: 
  - Open any file type directly in the UI
  - Syntax highlighting for all major languages
  - Multi-file editing with tabs

### 4. Universal Document Support
- **Smart Sheet Features** (like AlphaSense):
  - Advanced data visualization
  - Pivot tables and analytics
  - Real-time collaboration markers
- **Inline Document Editing** (like Claude Artifacts):
  - Direct editing without modal windows
  - Version history and diff views
  - Collaborative editing indicators

### 5. Microsoft Office Integration
- **Excel CRUD Operations**:
  - Create, read, update, delete spreadsheets inline
  - Formula editing and validation
  - Chart creation and modification
  - Data import/export
- **PowerPoint CRUD Operations**:
  - Slide creation and editing
  - Template management
  - Presentation mode within UI
  - Animation and transition controls

### 6. Workflow Automation (n8n Integration)
- **Visual Workflow Builder**:
  - Drag-and-drop node editor
  - Custom workflow creation
  - MCP tool integration
  - Executable workflows as UI tabs
- **Workflow Management**:
  - Save and load workflows
  - Schedule and trigger automation
  - Monitor execution logs

### 7. Multi-Modal Content Display
- **Native Support for All Modalities**:
  - Images: Viewer with zoom, crop, edit
  - Audio: Waveform display, playback controls
  - Video: Player with timeline, annotations
  - 3D Models: Interactive viewer
  - PDFs: Native rendering with annotations
  - Diagrams: Mermaid, PlantUML support

### 8. Agentic Browser
- **Embedded Browser**:
  - Full browser instance within UI
  - Agent-controlled navigation
  - DOM inspection and manipulation
  - Network request monitoring
- **Automation Capabilities**:
  - Record and replay actions
  - Scraping and data extraction
  - Form filling and submission

### 9. Universal File Compatibility
- **Comprehensive File Support**:
  - All text formats (md, txt, rtf, etc.)
  - All code formats with syntax highlighting
  - Binary file hex editor
  - Archive extraction (zip, tar, etc.)
  - Database file viewers (SQLite, etc.)
- **Inline Editing**:
  - Context-aware editors for each file type
  - Preservation of formatting
  - Validation and linting

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Multi-Tab System (Current Priority)
- Implement tab management UI
- Create workspace isolation
- Add session persistence
- Enable tab switching and state management

### Phase 2: Enhanced File Management
- Visual file explorer
- Inline file editing
- Multi-file support

### Phase 3: Code Rendering
- Live preview system
- Hot reload functionality
- Split view implementation

### Phase 4: Document Integration
- Smart sheet features
- Inline document editing
- MS Office support

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- Workflow automation
- Multi-modal support
- Agentic browser
- Universal compatibility

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Zustand for state management
- Monaco Editor for code editing
- React-Window for virtualization
- WebSocket for real-time updates

### Component Architecture
- Modular, reusable components
- Lazy loading for performance
- Virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Service workers for offline capability

### State Management
- Per-tab state isolation
- Global state for UI preferences
- Persistent storage with IndexedDB
- Real-time sync with backend

## Success Metrics
- Support 20+ concurrent tabs without performance degradation
- Sub-100ms tab switching
- Native-like file editing experience
- 60fps UI interactions
- Zero data loss on refresh/crash

## Design Principles
1. **Performance First**: Every feature must maintain 60fps UI
2. **Native Feel**: Interactions should feel like desktop applications
3. **Data Integrity**: Never lose user work
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new file types and features
5. **Developer Experience**: Intuitive for both end-users and contributors
